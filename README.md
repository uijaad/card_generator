## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that allows developers to make web pages interactive, responsive, and capable of handling real-time user actions.
It runs in the browser and adds logic, behavior, and functionality to otherwise static HTML and CSS.

## How to Set Up Live Server

1. Install the **Live Server** extension in VS Code.
2. Open your project folder in VS Code.
3. Right-click your main HTML file (e.g., `index.html`).
4. Click **"Open with Live Server"** to launch your site in a local development server.

This automatically refreshes the browser whenever you save changes.
